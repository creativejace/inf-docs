It is important to note that these ID are subject to what is known as the Unstaking Time, an on-chain parameterized period of time upon which all delegates, including validators, must wait for their ID to become fully Unstaked. In addition, these ID are still subject to be potentially slashed upon commitment of any byzantine behavior. The UnstakingTime ensures a variety of security measures in the network, such as accounting for network synchronization, limiting the duration of certain types of attacks, and solving the “nothing-at-stake” problem. |

|  25   | Delegator – Can a validator run away with their delegators' ID?                                             | By delegating to a validator, a user delegates voting power. This does not mean that the validator has custody of their delegators' ID. By no means can a validator run away with its delegator's funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

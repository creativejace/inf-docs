# Governance

## Introduction

Verifiable and persistent identity is the foundation of all economic systems. Industrialized societies built robust, functional identity verification platforms, and thus have access to lower cost capital (due to lower perceived risk), which promotes capital concentration, creating a self-fulfilling system of the poor staying relatively poorer. The industrialized societies have been, until now, unable to accept risk at the same rates in emerging societies. The lack of that identity is a major impediment to service access by the poor and those unable to directly participate in the global digital economy.

With the advent of the Identification Network, that paradigm changes, bringing those communities without access to trustworthy legal identity into the 21st century digital economy. This is done by providing the people of these communities with digital identities, digital wallets, and document management stored on their own database-accessible and controllable by that individual along with the education and training to properly gain adoption.

By incorporating biometrics, (and through partnerships) existing government IDs and 3rd party attestations that are housed in this distributed, user-owned database, the INF extends digital identity, digital wallets and document storage to populations that do not own a personal device; although enrollment requires a smartphone, usage & ownership of this user-centric identity + wallet + documents only requires biometrics (i.e. face) and a PIN. With the proverbial shirt on one’s back, one is able to be verified, access one’s wallet, manage one’s documents and engage in global value exchange in the 21st century economy.

Individuals who own mobile phones will be able to expand their digital identity with additional sources of data and leverage it in more flexible ways. A user-centric, biometrically verifiable identity solves the problems that have plagued the 3+ billion people living in poverty.

By empowering individuals with the tools to protect and manage their own identity data, and importantly allows them to profit from institutions that wish to access data or verify their identity. For example, governments, banks, hospitals, utilities and other large institutions (“Network Customers”) need to verify identities to do such things as open a bank account, provide a mobile phone and SIM card, give and track a vaccine, get a SIM card, and receive food.

Purpose, Mission and Principles

The Policies aim to:

- Provide impartiality and avoid preferential treatment to specific groups and communities;
- Provide voting in alignment with the INF’s mission and vision to ensure inclusivity, and access to financial services for the world’s population
- Establish a safe, secure and dependable set of Validators to ensure the safety and stability of the network
- Provide an equitable process through which new users, groups and communities can establish Validators.
- Create a governance system that empowers the community, and not the INF or Everest Network, Ltd., to drive the path forward for the growth and management of its ecosystem
- Governable items include, for example, pricing for basic services, network fees, validator rewards, burning amounts. Additional items may include such items as grant proposals or targeting a specific vertical or geography may be subject to voting on a case-by-case basis.

## Organic Organizational Management

Governance is the process by which INF participants and node Validators can effect change for the ecosystem, by collectively supplying input to the INF Proposals (INPs) and securing the network by running independent nodes of EverFastChain. The ecosystem is governed by ID token holders and Validators who stake their ID tokens and submit votes via off-chain proposals that govern the ecosystem. The network utilizes the ID token on EverFastChain to function without the active participation of the INF or Everest Network, Ltd. The INF published a proposed set of schemas to determine pricing of basic services, and how node Validators will receive rewards in the future. Once the schema is determined by the community of users, Validators will be empowered to process transactions, vote on pricing. All successful proposals signify the approval of the community and must be accepted by the Validators. Validators have the ability to leave or not validate should they wish.

Governance generally, and proposals specifically, will fall within the roadmap established by the INF with community input. Pricing of basic services, validator rewards, transaction fee burning percentages, and similar parameters will be voted upon by Validators (and by extension, Delegators) four times per year. Additionally, larger directional changes may be voted on as well. The policy described here can change at any time as determined by the INF Board.
